Please note: This is prototype software. Use it at you own risk :)
There is no automated install procedure. Follow the steps below to install
PortTracker. 

1. Get nfdump-1.6.x and compile nfdump
This version of PortTracker doe *NOT* work with nfdump-1.5.x!

2. In unpacked nfdump src tree:
configure and compile nfdump-1.6.x

3. Set required paths for
o NFDUMP to directory of your nfdump sources
o RRDINCLUDE to the directory containing rrd.h
o LIBRRD to the directory containing librrd.

3. run ./do_compile It should produce the binary 'nftrack'
   Install this binary in the same directory as you have your nfdump binaries.

4. Create somewhere the port DBs directory:
This directory needs to be writable by the user $USER configured in nfsen.conf
and needs about 10GB of space. 

5. Edit Porttracker.pm:
Set $PORTSDBDIR to the port DBs directory.

6. Copy PortTracker.pm to the NfSen backend plugin dir.
   Copy PortTracker.php to the NfSen frontend plugin dir.

7. Edit nfsen.conf: Add the plugin for profile 'live': 
Example:
@plugins = (
	[ 'live',   'PortTracker'],
);

8. Initialize the ports-db:
As $USER run 'nftrack -I -d <path-to-ports-DBs>'
This takes some minutes or so ... have a coffee

9. Restart NfSen:
Run './nfsen reload'
Have a look at the syslog file to see if PortTracker loaded successfully:

10. After the next 5min update cycle: Point your browser to the NfSen page 
and select the Plugin Tab.
